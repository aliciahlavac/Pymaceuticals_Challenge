# Pymaceuticals_Challenge

In this Jupyter Notebook file, data on mice with tumors treated with various medications are analyzed.  Various graphs were created, including bar graphs counting the number of mice that got each treatment, a pie chart of the number of male mice versus the number of female mice, and a scatterplot of the tumor volume versus the average weight of the mouse. 

In order to run this file, two .csv files must be located in a data folder, Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv.
